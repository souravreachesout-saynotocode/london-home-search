# Agent Instructions

You operate within a 3-layer architecture:

**Layer 1: Directive** - SOPs in directives/
**Layer 2: Orchestration** - You (decision making)  
**Layer 3: Execution** - Python scripts in execution/

## Principles
1. Check execution/ for tools first
2. Self-anneal when things break
3. Update directives as you learn

## Directory Structure
- .tmp/ - Intermediate files (gitignored)
- execution/ - Python scripts
- directives/ - SOPs in Markdown
- .env - API keys (gitignored)
